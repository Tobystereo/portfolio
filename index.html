                <h1>Opera Lancaster</h1>
                <em>Advertising, Graphic Design</em>
                <p class="subheading">The Lancaster Opera has been around for over 50 years. Still, it remains largely unknown, especially among younger generations. A new marketing campaign is needed to raise awareness and to attract a new audience and yet be attainable with the available resources.</p>

                <h2>What we did:</h2>

                <p>Collateral design for current season, developed an event concept "Opera Tasting" to attract a new, younger audience, developed comps for an awareness campaign.</p>

                <h3>Event Concept</h3>
                <p>The Opera Tasting concept takes a cue from beer or wine tastings. It provides the curious with an opportunity to 'sample' opera music. In a one hour informal gathering that can easily be combined with an actual wine tasting attendees will be provided with some information about opera music in general, as well as with details about a performance of the current season. This will be augmented by individual songs or arias being performed on location. This provides a low-barrier opportunity to introduce newcomers to this art form and will increase visibility in the market.</p>

                <h3>Awareness Campaign</h3>
                <p>To reposition the opera in the local market and raise awareness of it's existence among a new audience a concept for a guerilla poster sticker campaign was developed that was true to the opera, yet lightheartedly  played with some of the stereotypes typically associated withi it (such as operas being sung in foreing languages).  </p>

                <h3>Collateral Design</h3>
                <p>For the 2012/2013 season a series of artwork for various collateral pieces was designed. Previously each play had a unique look, but lacked any kind of visual consistency, thus any brand recognition was lost. A new visual language was needed, that was recognizable and would stand apart from the crowd of busy, dark  and abstract artwork.</p>

                <h1>HeatMapper</h1>
                <em>Programming</em>
                <p class="subheading">I was laying out a UX report for a client including a section on competitive analysis I had researched. This called for a number of heat maps to be created. Our findings were still under review and also included some soft metrics which made it probable that our rating system would change. Creating each map in Illustrator would have been cumbersome and time-intensive, plus the work would have been obsolete if the values had been changed. A generative solution was needed. So I set out to create HeatMapper</p>

                <img src="" alt="" data-src-url="http://behance.vo.llnwd.net/profiles2/210142/projects/9311491/f9ac3be04ca8201c583fddb54bfe5e1b.png">
                <h2>What I did:</h2>

                <p>Created a tool to quickly generate heat maps and offers control over colors and allowed for some flexibility in regards to my data source.</p>

                <h3>Input:</h3>
                <p>HeatMapper reads an SVG file as well as an CSV spreadsheet. The map shapes labels — in my case the US states — need to correnspond to field values in the spreadsheet, but the tool allows the user to choose the column or row that is applicable. </p>

                <h3>Processing:</h3>
                <p>HeatMapper creates a gradient with as many steps as there are values between the highest and lowest value in the spreadsheet. displays colored version of the vector map.</p>

                <h3>Customization:</h3>
                <p>HeatMapper allows the user to customize the colors at both ends of the gradient.</p>

                <h3>Export:</h3>
                <p>HeatMapper offers PDF and ASE color swatch export, ideal to continue work in Illustrator.
PNG export is also available.</p>

                <small>In the development of HeatMapper I used a more complex data source: historic birth rates in the communities of my home state NorthRhine-Westphalia).</small>

                <h3>Result:</h3>
                <p>The maps created using HeatMapper became part of our report and its presentation for the client. HeatMapper took a similar amount of time to develop as creating the heatmaps by hand, but it was efficient not only because it can be reused in other projects, but also because our rating system did change and required all maps to be redone, which only took minutes using HeatMapper.</p>

                <em>UI/UX, Web Design, Web Development</em>
                <p class="subheading">HOPE International was non-profit with a growing support-base. This required a better communication platform. The existing website was not mobile-friendly and a separate mobile site had been developed as a stop-gap measure. This led to a variety of problems including mobile device users not being able to follow links from any email communication. At the same time the HOPE brand was evolving and the website needed a refresh.</p>
                <h2>What I Did:</h2>
                <p>I led the redesign initiative on the UX, Design and Front-end front. I created a CMS-friendly responsive CSS framework which allowed for rapid prototyping, but would also later allow content strategists and other marketing staff to easily lay out new content within the CMS without a real knowledge of HTML and CSS.</p>
                <h3>Research:</h3>
                <p>I conducted a competitive analysis of non-profit websites including their design direction, content hierarchy, navigational structure and naming conventions. Subsequently I devised a new navigational structure and content hierarchy.</p>

                <h3>Front-End Development:</h3>
                <p>I created a mobile-first responsive CSS framework that is CMS-friendly and in conjunction with the visual design provided design patterns that could easily be reused and applied to a variey of layout needs by even non-developers.</p>

                <h3>Design:</h3>
                <p>HOPE International employed a very earthy, rustic and dark design prior to the refresh. This had been effective in focussing on the hard work the organization does working to alleviate poverty in some of the most difficult places on earth. Visually this seemed to focus more on the problem of poverty rather than the hope the organization stands for. A lighter, more hopeful look was needed without completely abandoning the earthiness that had become a recognized part of the brand identity.</p>

                <p>We interviewed the stakeholders and the soon-to-be users of this product, mapped the current workflow. In close collaboration of developers and UX we sought ways to streamline the process and require as few user steps as possible to go though the process. </p>

                <p>Due to the visual nature of our clients we used wireframes in the requirements gathering process which proved to be very helpful and accelerated the project significantly.</p>

                <p>Once the initial requirements were established I created wireframes for the entire tool. After each two week agile sprint, we presented our progress to the client and were thankful to have chosen the agile methodology, as we kept finding out additional bits of information and requirements that the stakeholders/users were unaware of in our initial discovery, but as they saw proposed features and functionality they realized that elements and steps were missing that were part of their routine, yet not part of their official task list.</p>
                <p>Iterative wireframing became an essential part of our process and allowed us to much more quickly respond to changed requirements and still deliver on time. </p>

                <p>This project began by conducting extensive research of NeighborWorks organizations, the homebuying process and existing technology trends. We visited multiple NeighborWorks offices throughout the country and organized interviews with first-time homebuyers and real estate agents to get a solid understanding of the organization, the homebuyer and the market.</p>

                <h3>Developed a digital engagement tool.</h3>
                <p>We developed two distinctly different tool concepts that would increase engagement between NeighborWorks and its customers and help first-time homebuyers prepare for homeownership. Both tools were designed to accommodate a mobile and desktop browser experience.</p>

                <p class="subheading">Two years after andCulture originally working with GoodData, it was time to revisit the site and evolve the brand to something a little more buttoned up. GoodData is a company committed to redefining the way business intelligence works, and they’re out to accomplish one thing: connect more business people to business data to help them make better business decisions.</p>
                <p>The redesign came at a time when GoodData was repositioning how it sold its services. Bashes (business mashups) are GoodData’s new approach to BI and a new term that needed to be both explained and sold. That meant rethinking the story arc of the site and reigning in an abundance of content that had grown along with the business. Plus, it all had to be completed within a very tight turnaround for an industry show.</p>
                <p>This new position in the market required new ways to talk about and visualize their products. A number of interactive graphics were developed to do just that. </p>

                <p class="subheading">B+T, a successful structural engineering firm, came to andCulture with a desire to unite two separate-but-related companies under one name. Selling to the telecom industry as both “B &amp; T Engineering” and “BTE Management” was a bit convoluted for the growing Tulsa-based company. They sought our strategic advice on a solution—and then tasked us to translate it into a logical brand architecture and a compelling corporate identity including a new website.</p>
                <p>One of the main goals of the website was to attaract new talent. The website therefore needed to be a compelling and innovative experience to position the new brand in the market and to reflect their identity and culture of innovation to potential employees. This required meaningful interactions, transitions and animations to support the bold look. We decided to create a seamless interaction experience by developing a Wordpress-based one page web-app that allows the user to effortlessly navigate the site without the need to load new pages, but while maintaining the ease-of-use of a Wordpress backend to manage content through custom built Carrington Build modules.</p>

Asking people to regift the additional day they have been given, by donating one day of pay. The campaign is built around a video on <a href="http://leapfwd.us"target="_new">http://leapfwd.us</a>. A website had to be created that supported this call to action and allowed people to calculate their daily income. Two calculators were programmed and implemented on a responsive website, enabling users across devices to use the site.</p>
                <p>A second part of the website is the stories page that showcases various stories of people that have been helped by the organization.</p>
                <p>Following the metaphor of HOPE International helping the poor around the world leap forward, a world map was visualized. The countries HOPE works in were drawn on the map and green circles representing people helped by HOPE jump out and start leaping forward. The bottom of the screen features a selection of success stories that can be scrolled through and clicked to reveal the person’s story. Responsive implementation using jQuery and ProcessingJS and CSS3.</p>
                <p>In 2013 the campaign has been awarded a PDMA Benny Award.</p>
